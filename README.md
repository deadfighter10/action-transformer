# Enhanced Action Representation and Prediction Using High-Dimensional Embeddings and Transformer Architectures

# Abstract:

In this paper, we introduce an advanced approach to action representation and prediction by embedding actions into a 300-dimensional vector space. Leveraging cosine similarity and transformer architectures, specifically a customized GPT model, we aim to predict subsequent actions based on prior sequences. We enhance traditional methods by integrating dynamic contextual embeddings and a multi-head attention mechanism tailored for action data. Our approach requires minimal data and moves us closer to achieving Standard Artificial Intelligence by enabling machines to comprehend and anticipate human-like actions effectively.

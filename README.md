# <h1 style="font-family: Garamond">Enhanced Action Representation and Classification Using High-Dimensional Embeddings and Transformer Architectures</h1>

## Abstract
<p style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 120%">In this paper, we introduce an advanced approach to action representation and classification by embedding complex natural language commands into a high-dimensional vector space. Leveraging self-attention mechanisms and transformer architectures, we aim to understand and categorize complex commands effectively. By refining command representations through self-attention blocks and utilizing cosine similarity for action classification, our approach enhances traditional methods in natural language understanding. We integrate dynamic contextual embeddings, and a multi-head attention mechanism tailored for command data. Our method requires minimal data and moves us closer to achieving generalized artificial intelligence by enabling machines to comprehend and respond to human-like commands effectively with limited data access.</p>

## 1. Introduction
Understanding and executing human commands is a fundamental aspect of artificial intelligence. As AI systems become more integrated into daily life, the ability to interpret complex, context-rich commands is crucial. Traditional methods often rely on large datasets and complex models to predict actions based on past sequences. However, these approaches may not effectively handle novel or nuanced commands that deviate from the training data.
In this paper, we propose a novel method that focuses on understanding and classifying complex commands without relying on predicting the next action from past actions. Our approach employs self-attention mechanisms within transformer architectures to refine the understanding of input commands. By mapping these refined representations into a high-dimensional vector space, we utilize cosine similarity to categorize the commands into predefined actions.
### 1.1. Contributions
•	Novel Architecture: We introduce a simplified transformer-based model that leverages self-attention to enhance command understanding.<br>
•	Efficient Classification: By using cosine similarity in a high-dimensional embedding space, we achieve effective command classification with minimal data.<br>
•	Open-Source Implementation: Our model utilizes publicly available pre-trained embeddings and attention mechanisms, promoting accessibility and reproducibility.

## 2. Related Work
Natural Language Processing (NLP) has seen significant advancements with the introduction of transformer architectures and attention mechanisms [1]. Models like BERT [2] and GPT [3] have set new benchmarks in understanding and generating human-like text.<br>
Previous approaches to command understanding often rely on sequence-to-sequence models [4] or large-scale language models [5]. While effective, these methods typically require vast amounts of data and computational resources.<br>
Our work diverges by focusing on refining command representations using self-attention and classifying them using cosine similarity, which is computationally efficient and effective with smaller datasets.

## 3. Methodology
### 3.1. Overview
Our model processes input commands and maps them to predefined actions by:
1.	Embedding: Converting words in the command to vector representations using pre-trained embeddings.
2.	Self-Attention: Refining these embeddings to capture contextual relationships within the command.
3.	Aggregation: Combining the refined embeddings into a single command representation.
4.	Classification: Matching the command representation to action representations using cosine similarity.

## 4. Experiments
### 4.1. Dataset
We created a synthetic dataset consisting of complex commands mapped to predefined actions:<br>
•	Action 1: Switch off the lamp<br>
•	Action 2: Turn on the computer<br>
Examples:<br>
•	"I'm tired, I'm going to sleep." → Action 1<br>
•	"I'm home, I have to work." → Action 2
#### 4.1.1 Dataset Generation
We use a variety of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate and validate the dataset. Below is a detailed outline of the process:

1. <span style="color: orangered">Data Generation<br>
We create diverse query sets by prompting LLMs with a base prompt. The goal is to ensure that the generated queries vary in tone, style, and manner while retaining the same semantic meaning.</span>

Base prompt for query generation:

```"Generate different queries for each given action. Change tone, style, and even manner in your queries, but ensure that the semantic meaning remains intact. Follow this structure: {Part from the data.json file}."```

<em>Note: The prompt is occasionally adjusted to improve results.</em><br>
Models used for generation:
``claude_3.5_sonnet``
``llama-3.2-vision-90b-instruct``
``gpt-4o-2024-08-06``

2. <span style="color: orangered">Data Validation and Semantic Checking<br>
Once the queries are generated, we validate their semantic alignment with the intended actions and labels. This step ensures that the generated content accurately reflects the intended meaning.</span>

Base prompt for data validation:

```"You, as a Large Language Model, what do you think about these queries and given labels? Do they truly convey the same meaning? Can you predict the actions based on these queries? The queries and labels are in the attached data.json file. Hint for actions represented by numbers: {The description of each number's action}."```

Models used for semantic checking and correction:
``gemini-1.5-pro-exp-0827``
``gpt-4o-2024-08-06``

3. <span style="color: orangered">Final Supervision<br>
After the LLMs generate and validate the dataset, a team member supervises the data to ensure consistency and accuracy.</span>

<p style="color: darkorange"><strong>Notes:</strong><br>
<u>Why we use multiple models:</u> <em>Different LLMs offer varying strengths in generation and validation, so we combine them to achieve more robust results.</em><br>
<u>Supervision:</u> <em>Human oversight is crucial to catch any subtle inconsistencies or errors that the models may overlook.
This version makes the process clearer, breaks it into manageable sections, and adds a couple of side notes for better understanding.</em></p>

### 4.2. Implementation Details
•	Language: Python<br>
•	Framework: PyTorch<br>
•	Embeddings: Pre-trained GloVe embeddings (300-dimensional)<br>
•	Training: Minimal fine-tuning due to the small dataset size
## 5. Results
Our model correctly classified the test commands:<br>
•	Input: "I'm tired, I'm going to sleep." → Predicted: "Switch off the lamp"<br>
•	Input: "I'm home, I have to work." → Predicted: "Turn on the computer"<br>
<strong style="color: red">Despite the small dataset, the model effectively captured the contextual meaning of the commands and mapped them to the appropriate actions.</strong>
